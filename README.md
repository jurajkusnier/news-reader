# News Reader

News Reader combines the most used libraries and best practices that you can use as the template for your next android project.

## About
The app loads the latest articles from [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and saves them for offline access. It contains two screens, a list of the latest articles, and an article preview.
Feel free to use this project as a template for your own app.

**Disclaimer:** Work in progress. This is not the final state of the template

## Architecture Overview
- Android [MVVM Design Pattern](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) with ViewModel, Repository and LiveData 
- [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) using Safe Args to pass data with type safety.
- Kotlin [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) + Asynchronous Flow
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) + Moshi to make API calls
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) as offline cache
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) as a DI
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) image loading library

## Building
To build the project you have to copy `client.default.properties` to `client.properties` and replace `API_KEY` with your api key.
